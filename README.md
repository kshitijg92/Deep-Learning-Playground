# Deep-Learning-Playground

This repository was built while going through the excellent courses on deep learning by Jeremy Howard on [fast.ai](http://www.fast.ai/). As such, most of the notebooks are built upon the notebooks provided through the course. What I have tried doing is explaning everything in as much detail as I could in the notebooks itself. I am hoping these might help other deep learning enthusiasts to get a quick start.

**NOTE 1**

These notebooks are best viewed by installing [jupyter_contrib_nbextensions](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions). While installing the above package, you can also install [jupyter_nbextensions_configurator](https://github.com/Jupyter-contrib/jupyter_nbextensions_configurator) which gives a nice UI where you can simply use checkboxes to enable and disable extensions.

This is because I have tried adding proper collapsible headings, titles, summaries to make the viewing easier.

**NOTE 2**

The GAN notebooks are still under work.
