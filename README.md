# Deep-Learning-Playground

This repository was built while going through the excellent courses on deep learning by Jeremy Howard on [fast.ai](http://www.fast.ai/). As such, most of the notebooks are built upon the notebooks provided through the course. What I have tried doing is explaning everything in as much detail as I could in the notebooks itself. I am hoping these might help other deep learning enthusiasts to get a quick start.

NOTE : 

The GAN notebooks are still under work.
